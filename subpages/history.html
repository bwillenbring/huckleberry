        You may love or hate Val Kilmer’s performance in the 1993 production of
        the Tombstone film – most love it. Some even criticized him for
        misquoting his script. It brought confusion to the huckleberry meaning
        of Doc Holliday’s famous turn of phrase.
        <br />
		BUT YOU MAY BE WONDERING....
        <br />
        So what does “I’m your huckleberry” mean? It became a debated question
        among Val Kilmer’s fans and critics of the film. They have different
        interpretations of this idiom. It is also unclear where the idea came
        from. Some credit it to Mark Twain for Huckleberry Finn. Here is an
        attempt to find the ultimate meaning of the famous American quote.
        <br />
        I’m Your Huckleberry, Gun and Aces tattoo
        <br />
        Doc Holliday I’m Your Huckleberry Tattoo
        <br />
        It was a late day when the Earp brothers stood talking to each other in
        front of the Oriental. The Southern air was only starting to get heated
        up when an intoxicated Johnny Ringo appeared on the scene. He stood
        there on the sidewalk of Allen Street with glaring eyes and arms on his
        pocket as if ready to make the kill.
        <br />
        <br />
        The drunken man was looking for trouble. He gawked at the two other men
        to fight him, but they refused. Disgusted at this blatant rejection,
        Ringo screams out loud.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Wretched slugs!"
        <br />
        <br />
        he taunted.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Don't any of you have the guts to play for blood?"
        <br />
        <br />
        Then comes Doc Holliday's dramatic entrance.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can hear Val Kilmer's masculine voice speaking off-scene as the two
        brothers slowly walk away from the mad man. Acknowledging Ringo's
        impetus, he utters the phrase calmly,
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        "I'm your huckleberry."
        <br />
        <br />
        When Ringo turns to see him, he gives away a sly smile saying,
        <br />
        <br />
        "That's just my game".
        <br />
        <br />
        The two men begin to face each other for the duel when Ringo's good old
        friend comes into the scene to take him out of trouble. It's a pretty
        exciting scene from the 1993 historical action film Tombstone. But,
        what's even more interesting is the meaning of that turn of phrase.
        <br />
        So, you ask. What does “I’m your huckleberry” or “I’ll be your
        huckleberry” mean? Well, it basically means you’re up to do something
        for someone. In other words, you’re in for the game or the task at hand.
        <br />
        The huckleberry is a small, round wild berry that grows mainly in the
        southeast of the United States. It resembles the blueberry in color and
        shape. Because of its size, people use the word figuratively to describe
        something that is of little importance. It wasn’t the genius of the
        Tombstone filmmakers that made the peculiar expression famous. They were
        only being faithful to the original manuscript from Walter Noble Burns
        in 1929. Mark Twain even used it as an inspiration for naming
        Huckleberry Finn. The real Doc Holliday may have actually been saying
        those words in his lifetime.
        <br />
        Huckleberry was quite a fashionable word in the nineteenth century.
        People use it to express sweet and gentle affection. Gambling circles
        also draw on the huckleberry to describe something small. The
        huckleberry meaning in Doc’s statement spells trouble for Johnny Ringo.
        It would be funny to think of Mark Twain’s idea in the Tombstone film.
        <br />
        The literal huckleberry meaning may also come from the way of picking
        huckleberries. Harvesting these berries comes pretty easy. You can strip
        them off the bush in one fell swoop. To say I’m your huckleberry is also
        like saying pick me or choose me. This huckleberry meaning fits well
        with Finn’s character in Mark Twain’s novel. He is Tom Sawyer’s faithful
        companion and trusty sidekick. The author also used huckleberry in an
        article published in 1880 to describe a milking cow. The story came out
        even before The Adventures of Huckleberry Fin was published.
        <br />
        Huckleberry Finn already appeared in Mark Twain’s first novel, The
        Adventures of Tom Sawyer. He described Sawyer as being a little bit
        jealous of the little Huck Finn. It sounds amusing to hear Doc Holliday
        speaking that idiom to Johnny Ringo in the Tombstone film. It was indeed
        a pretty clever way to pick on the crackbrain..
